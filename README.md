Name of your team: AgSales

Abstract: 
There is a lack of products connecting agricultural growers and distributors who buy agricultural products. Our product aims to fill that gap by providing an online forum between these parties. We will connect growers and distributors through profiles, product listings, categories, and user-generated tags.

Background:
Kush Marketplace, a wholesale platform connecting cannabis growers with end consumers, already exists. However, Kush Marketplace only serves customers in Washington and California, and only the recreational market. Additionally, Kush Marketplace only deals in cannabis, not all agricultural products. Our product connects growers and distributors, no transactions are handled on our application.
